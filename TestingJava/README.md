# Spring Boot Unit Testing Practice

## Overview

Welcome to the **Spring Boot Unit Testing Practice** directory! This project is dedicated to practicing unit testing in Spring Boot applications. It provides examples and exercises specifically designed to improve your skills in writing effective unit tests for Spring Boot components.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on environment for learning and practicing unit testing techniques in Spring Boot. It covers various scenarios for testing individual components, such as controllers, services, and repositories, in isolation.

## Getting Started

To get started with practicing Spring Boot unit testing, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-unit-testing-practice.git
   cd spring-boot-unit-testing-practice
   ```

2. **Explore the tests**:
   Navigate to the `src/test` directory to find various test classes covering different Spring Boot components.

3. **Run the tests**:
   Use your preferred IDE or Maven command line to run the unit tests. For example:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Practice and experiment**:
   Modify the existing tests, create new test cases, and experiment with different testing strategies to enhance your understanding and proficiency in Spring Boot unit testing.
