# Advanced Java

## Overview

Welcome to the **Advanced Java** repository. This repository contains the code and projects I developed while following an advanced Java course. The course provided a comprehensive dive into various advanced topics of Java, including core Java concepts, exception handling, threading, object-oriented programming, file I/O operations, JDBC, the DAO pattern, and Servlets, along with practical exercises and examples.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of my learning journey through advanced Java programming. It encompasses code that illustrates the theoretical concepts taught in the course, providing practical implementations and examples. Each module in this repository reflects a specific topic or aspect of Java programming that was covered in the course.

## Topics Covered

### Core Java Concepts
The foundation of Java programming, including:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Collections framework
- JavaBeans conventions

### Exception Handling
Techniques to handle errors gracefully and effectively:
- Try-catch blocks
- Custom exceptions
- Multi-catch and rethrowing exceptions

### Threading
Concurrency and multi-threading concepts in Java:
- Creating and managing threads
- Synchronization techniques
- Using the concurrency utilities

### Java Folder Structures
Understanding the standard layout of Java projects:
- Organizing source code
- Using packages for code management
- Best practices for project structure

### Package Keyword
Utilizing the `package` keyword for organizing classes:
- Defining packages
- Importing and using packages
- Package-level access control

### File Importation and Exportation
Performing file I/O operations:
- Reading from and writing to files
- Handling file paths and directories
- Serialization of objects

### Object-Oriented Programming
Implementing OOP principles:
- Creating and using classes and objects
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Interfaces and abstract classes

### JDBC and DAO
Database interaction using JDBC and the DAO pattern:
- Setting up JDBC for database connectivity
- Performing CRUD operations
- Designing and implementing DAOs for data management

### Servlets and Tomcat Setup
Developing web applications with Servlets:
- Writing and configuring servlets
- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Setting up and deploying to Tomcat server

## Usage

The content in this repository is organized by topic, with each topic demonstrating specific Java programming concepts and techniques. This code can be used as a reference for learning or revisiting advanced Java programming topics. Each module includes examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts learned.

### Examples
- **Threading**: Explore how to create, manage, and synchronize threads to perform concurrent operations.
- **JDBC and DAO**: See practical implementations of connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and managing data access using the DAO pattern.
- **Servlets**: Understand how to build and deploy web applications using Servlets and Tomcat.

## Notes

- The code in this repository is intended for educational purposes, reflecting my learning and understanding of advanced Java concepts.
- It is not intended for production use but can be a valuable resource for learning and experimentation.
